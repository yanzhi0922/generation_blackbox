Scroll down for video Service on a New York City subway line (pictured) was suspended for almost two hours after smoke in an underwater tunnel left hundreds of passengers stuck beneath the East River More than 500 passengers were taken to Manhattan after spending roughly an hour and a half trapped. They walked through their stalled train into a rescue train and left around 10am Part of the train's contact shoe, which gets power from the third rail, is thought to have touched the board instead of the rail, sparking the incident that left service on the 7 train suspended for just less than two hours. The last of the passengers were taken on to the new train around 10am, according to AMNY. No injuries were reported beyond a woman who felt faint and requested medical attention. The MTA has warned passengers to expect delays on other lines such as the N,Q, and R. More than 500 passengers were taken to Manhattan after spending roughly an hour and a half trapped beneath the East River. Above, firefighters seen at Grand Central Station Commuters faced delays and crowds of people as they tried to travel from Queens into Manhattan. Service resumed around 10.30am after the incident, believed to be caused by a train's conduct with a safety board Commuters trips on the 7 line were disrupted, with some taking unusual transport methods such as boats to get to work. Residents of Queens have recently complained about what they view as particularly poor service on the 7, which goes through the heart of their borough. A rally was held last month calling for less delays on the line after a winter of outages, according to DNA Info.",

The official did not rule out that captives from other Boko Haram camps that were raided might be girls abducted in April 2014 from a school in Chibok. The official said he would have the final word by day's end on Wednesday. [Previous story, posted at 4:52 p.m. ET] Nigerian troops rescued 200 girls and 93 women Tuesday in the Sambisa Forest, the Nigerian Armed Forces announced on its official Twitter account. The armed forces could not immediately confirm if any of the rescued girls were among the 200 schoolgirls the militant group Boko Haram kidnapped in April 2014 from the village of Chibok. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said the rescued girls and women are still being screened and none has spoken to their families yet. The 2014 mass abduction from Chibok led to an international social media movement, #BringBackOurGirls, to rescue them. Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, has been kidnapping females for years and has hundreds in their custody. Nigerian troops also captured and destroyed three terrorist camps in the Sambisa Forest, the armed forces said. Chibok and the Sambisa Forest are both in the northeastern part of the country. Olukolade said troops are still combing the forest. In recent weeks, Nigerian troops and vigilantes moved into the Sambisa Forest, a known hideout for Boko Haram. Last Wednesday the troops had to retreat because of explosive devices Boko Haram planted in the forest, according to military sources and a vigilante who was with the troops. On Monday, troops re-entered the forest and on Tuesday afternoon they raided two Boko Haram camps and rescued scores of girls and women. Information about the fate of the kidnapped schoolgirls has been spotty and inconsistent, with some school officials giving conflicting figures for the number of girls who were abducted or escaped their captors. \"We have no idea where the Chibok girls are or were,\" CNN correspondent Christian Purefoy said Tuesday. The name Boko Haram translates to \"Western education is sin\" in the local Hausa language. The group has said its aim...",

Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes his side must win their last six games to finish inside top four Saints remained in the hunt for a place in next season's Champions League by beating Hull at St Mary's Southampton are five points behind Man City Saints have five points to claw back on the reigning champions but Koeman believes it is possible if they win all their remaining games. 'Normally yes,' the Dutchman said. 'The distance is five points. We need to win I think all. 'They (City) don't lose three games, no. They have the next two at home. Normally, with the players that they have, the qualities. 'You never know, but it's all about to win the last six to have really a good chance to be one of the top four teams.' Saints travel to the Etihad Stadium on the final day of the season and, by contrast to the other sides chasing a top-four berth, have a kind set of fixtures before that. Tottenham and Aston Villa come to St Mary's, while trips to Sunderland, Leicester and City follow Saturday's match at Stoke. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle scored in his side's 2-0 Premier League win over Hull Stoke vs Southampton - April 18 Southampton vs Tottenham - April 25 Sunderland vs Southampton - May 2 Leicester vs Southampton - May 9 Southampton vs Aston Villa - May 16 Manchester City vs Southampton - May 24 'Yeah, but in the last part of the season, OK, what's the best to play against?' Koeman asked. 'A team who's fighting for no relegation or two teams who are fighting for the title? I don't know. 'Every game is difficult. You have to be on your level to win a game. All are difficult. 'We play Sunderland away, we play Leicester away and they're fighting for not going down and that's even difficult.' Koeman is certainly not taking the run-in lightly and the trip to the Britannia Stadium will be an interesting test for Southampton's players at this stage...",

The comedian took a fake tumble on the red carpet Tuesday night at the 2015 TIME 100 gala in New York -- right in front of fellow honorees Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, who stepped around her as they moved down the line. The stunt drew guffaws from the paparazzi and other onlookers, although Kanye -- perhaps not used to being upstaged -- looked unamused. \"I saw them, and I asked my publicist, 'Can I dive in front of them and act like I fell?' And she said, 'I can't stop you,' \" Schumer told People. The prank came the same night the third season of Schumer's hit show, \"Inside Amy Schumer,\" premiered on Comedy Central. The episode has won praise for its \"Milk Milk Lemonade\" video, which ridicules mens' obsession with a certain female body part, and a \"Friday Night Lights\" parody in which high school football players protest their new coach's \"no raping\" policy. And it came the night after Schumer appeared on CBS' \"The Late Show\" and turned David Letterman red-faced when she lifted her dress to show him a scar she got from surfing and said, \"That's my vagina.\" Letterman, who had urged her to \"do something now that you'll regret,\" turned to the chortling audience and said, \"Well, I asked for it, didn't I?\" So yes, you can say Schumer -- who in the past two weeks has graced the cover of Entertainment Weekly, hosted the MTV Movie Awards and learned her TV show was just renewed for a fourth season -- is having a moment. \"They were right there!

So, there are 8 purple flowers in Mark's garden.\n\nStep 2: Find the total number of yellow and purple flowers.\nNow, we need to add the number of yellow flowers (10) and the number of purple flowers (8) to get the total number of yellow and purple flowers.

To find the number of green flowers, we need to multiply the total number of yellow and purple flowers (18) by 25% (or 0.25). Therefore, the number of green flowers is 18 * 0.25 = 4.5.

Since she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime. Therefore, the amount of overtime she works is 50-8 = <<50-8=42>>42 hours. \n\nNow, we can calculate her overtime pay. According to the problem, her overtime pay is calculated by adding 1/2 of her hourly wage to her hourly wage. Therefore, her overtime pay is 18+.5*18 = <<18+.5*18=27>>27 dollars per hour. \n\nFinally, we can calculate her total pay. Her total pay is calculated by adding her hourly wage for the 8 hours of work and her overtime pay. Therefore, her total pay is 18*8+27*42 = <<18*8+27*42=766>>766 dollars. \n\nTherefore, Tina makes 766 dollars in total.\n\nThe answer is: 766.",

In the third hundred years, the ship was again built larger, and it had twice as many people as the ship in the second hundred years. Therefore, the number of people on the ship in the third hundred years was (S * 2) * 2.\n4. If we add up the number of people on the ships in all three centuries, we get 847 + S + S * 2 + (S * 2) * 2 = 3 * S + 2 * S * 2 + 847.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 3S + 4 * S = 847.\n6.

Since he has $15 in change after buying the shoes, which cost $95, he has saved up $110 in total (95+15=110). \n\nNext, we can calculate how much money he earned from mowing lawns. Since he charges $15 to mow a lawn and he mowed 4 lawns, he earned $60 from mowing lawns (15*4=60).\n\nFinally, we can calculate how much money he earned from shoveling driveways. We know that he has saved up $110 in total, and he spent $95 on shoes, so he has earned $15 from mowing lawns and shoveling driveways (110-95=15). We also know that he earned $60 from mowing lawns, so he earned $9 from shoveling driveways (15-60=(-60)-9).\n\nSince Tobias charges $7 to shovel a driveway, we can calculate how many driveways he shoveled by dividing the total amount he earned from shoveling driveways by the cost of shoveling one driveway. Therefore, he shoveled 1 driveway (9/7=1).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that Tobias shoveled 1 driveway.\n\nThe answer is: 1.",
